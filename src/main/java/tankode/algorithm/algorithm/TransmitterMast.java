/**
 * {@code TransmitterMast}s have to be distributed over the map - each mast has
 * a {@code MastType}, specifying its {@code cost} (how expensive it is) and
 * {@code areaOfCoverage} (where it provides what signal strength). In an area
 * covered by multiple masts, those signal strengths add up. Masts can only be
 * placed inside the country and have to cover it optimally. There can also
 * only be a maximum of one mast per area.</br>
